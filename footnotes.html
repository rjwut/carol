<dt>
  Why Dickens wrote <cite>A Christmas Carol</cite>
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Dickens wrote <cite>A Christmas Carol</cite> for two reasons. First, he needed money. Sales of <cite>Martin Chuzzlewit</cite> were starting to peter out, and the publisher was threatening to reduce his pay. His wife was pregnant with their fifth child, and money was tight. Dickens needed something to bring income, and quickly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Second, he was greatly affected by the plight of the poor, having grown up in poverty himself, and having witnessed the conditions in a prison, of children working in a tin mine, and at a “ragged school” (a charitable organization devoted to providing free education to poor children). After dismissing the idea of publishing a political pamphlet, he instead wrote <cite>A Christmas Carol</cite> in just six weeks.
  </p>
  <p>
    After his manuscript was returned by the printer, Dickens had it beautifully bound in goatskin leather and gave it to Thomas Milton, his friend and solicitor, who had previously loaned him £270. The manuscript is now owned by The Morgan Library and Museum, and <a href="https://www.themorgan.org/collections/works/dickens/ChristmasCarol" target="_blank">may be viewed on their web site</a>.

</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    It was noted by Dickens’s friend John Forster that, while Dickens did not personally believe in ghosts, he was fascinated with ghost stories. Indeed, for some time after <cite>A Christmas Carol</cite> was published, he put out an annual ghost story.
  </p>
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>
  …and no one wish to lay it.
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    To lay a ghost is to exorcise it. Also, the expression “to lay the ghost of something” means to stop worrying or being upset about something that has bothered one for a long time. Dickens hopes that the story and its message will stick with you. This may also be a pun with “lay it [down];” in other words, that you will find the story engaging and therefore difficult to put down.

<h2>Stave One: Marley’s Ghost</h2>
<dl>
<dt>
  stave
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    “Stave” is an archaic form of the word “staff,” which is a stanza of a song or poem. The title of the work refers to itself as being a Christmas carol (song) in prose form, so the labeling of the acts is appropriately musical.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  Jacob Marley
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Several of the names used in <cite>A Christmas Carol</cite> are meaningful. A <i>Jacobus</i> was an English gold coin from the reign of James I (1567-1625). “Marley” comes from a word meaning “soil” or “sleet.”
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  Ebenezer Scrooge
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    “Ebenezer” is a Biblical name which means “stone of help.” Scrooge is noted as a being “hard and sharp as steel,” but by the end of the story he does indeed help the Cratchit family.
  </p>
  <p>
    The term “Ebenezer” was also used to mean “dissenter.” It was used to refer to churches (mostly Methodist or Baptist) which were not part of the Church of England, originally from the name of one such church.
  </p>
  <p>
    A “scrooge” was a tight, squeezing crowd. Scrooge is mentioned in the text as a “squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner.” Today, of course, thanks to this story, a miser is referred to as a “scrooge.” It is unfortunate that his name is now irrevocably associated with cold-heartedness and avarice, as the beauty of the story is in his redemption.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  …Scrooge’s name was good upon ’Change…
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    “’Change” refers to the Royal Exchange, where Scrooge is shown to have business. At the time that <cite>A Christmas Carol</cite> was published, the Exchange had burned down almost six years previously. Queen Victoria opened the new Exchange the following year.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is interesting to observe that, whatever his other faults, Scrooge is noted here for his trustworthiness. If Scrooge gives his word, one can rely on it. This makes his later commitment to change his ways more meaningful; otherwise, it could be be seen as an empty promise, made in a moment of desperation.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  as dead as a door-nail
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Dickens didn’t invent this phrase; it originates from at least the thirteenth century, and Shakespeare popularized it in <cite>Henry IV</cite> and <cite>Henry VI</cite>. It’s usage here was inspired by a dream Dickens had, in which one of his good friends had died, and someone in the dream referred to them as being dead “as a door-nail.”

</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Marley had no family, and no friends other than Scrooge, so Scrooge was the executor of Marley’s estate. Scrooge is such a miser that the comfort he receives from Marley’s funeral is principally from how inexpensive it was.

    Saint Paul’s is an Anglican cathedral in London, not far from Cornhill. It was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, and completely rebuilt by 1697.

  Hamlet
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    In <cite>Hamlet</cite>, act I, scene 4, Hamlet meets the ghost of his late father on the ramparts of the castle Elsinore. Dickens compares Marley’s visit to Scrooge with the visit Hamlet receives from his father, saying that neither encounter would have been remarkable had Marley and King Hamlet still been alive.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  Scrooge and Marley
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    In his youth, Dickens lived near a tradesman’s business with a sign that read “Goodge and Marney,” which may have influenced the names of Scrooge and Marley.
  </p>
  <p>
    We aren’t told exactly where Scrooge’s place of business is located. It is almost certainly in Cornhill, as it was considered the center of finance in London and is where the Royal Exchange is found, which Scrooge is noted to have visited regularly for business. Cratchit is also mentioned to have gone to slide down its namesake hill after work on Christmas Eve. Another clue is the mention of a church belltower with gothic windows, which is visible from the office. Finally, the court where his business was found was noted to be extremely narrow. These clues have lead some to suggest Newman’s Court as a likely candidate, as it is very narrow and is directly across from St. Michael’s Church in Cornhill, which has a belltower with gothic windows. Today, just a few steps down the street is a hotel and pub called, appropriately enough, The Counting House.

  <p>
    Dickens indulges in a pun here: to “come down” means to give money. One of Scrooge’s most notable characteristics is his miserliness. Scrooge may have been partially inspired by John Elwes, a member of parliament who was so notorious for being a skinflint that he was commonly known as “John the Miser”.

  the weather
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    The descriptions that Dickens provides of the weather throughout the book reflects the mood in that particular section of the work. Through most of the book, the weather is repeatedly described as oppressively cold and foggy. This type of weather emphasizes dreariness and isolation: people avoid going out in such weather, and when they do, the fog obscures vision and isolates the traveller. This reflects Scrooge’s own disposition: hard, lonely, and bitter. In the happier parts, the fog clears and the cold is described as invigorating rather than oppressive.

  palpable brown air
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    “Palpable” means “touchable;” the smog was so thick that you could almost feel it. Today we might say that “you could cut it with a knife.” Back then, people burned coal in their homes to heat them and cook food, and the emissions from the dense population made the air visibly brown from the coal smoke.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  …lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    “Hard by” means “nearby.” The process of brewing involves very hot liquids, producing much steam. Dickens says here that the fog was so thick that you might think that large-scale brewing activity was happening nearby.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  heat and cold
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    The office is barely warmed at all due to the pitiful fire, which Scrooge’s miserliness ensures will remain tiny. The fire in Scrooge’s own home is later described as being equally tiny, so much so that “He was obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it.” In contrast, Scrooge’s nephew and even the struggling Cratchits are shown to have welcoming fires. This is a reflection of their own hearts: cold and solitary versus warm and open. Imagery of heat and cold are repeatedly used in this way throughout the story.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    The fact that Scrooge prevents Cratchit from getting more coal is often looked at as an indication of his greediness. However, it is later noted that Scrooge spends little money on his own comfort, so it seems inconsistent that Scrooge is hoarding the coal to keep it for himself. What this may indicate is that Scrooge thinks Cratchit to be irresponsible with his resources, as Scrooge considers comfort to be of little value. This may be how Scrooge justifies to himself his clerk’s low salary: why increase his pay if he would only waste it?
  </p>
  <p>
    Why is Scrooge’s fire larger than Cratchit’s, then? Cratchit works in a “tank,” indicating that the area in which he works is smaller than Scrooge’s, and therefore logically should not require as large a fire to heat. Scrooge doesn’t care about Cratchit’s comfort nor his own; the office is heated at all only because frozen fingers cannot write.

  Humbug!
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    A “humbug” is a hoax or fraud. Here, as an exclamation, it is used in a roughly equivalent manner to “Nonsense!” Scrooge utters the word six times in the text (not counting one instance where he stops after the first syllable), all of them before or during Marley’s visitation. Given what we learn about Scrooge from his time with the Ghost of Christmas Past, it is perhaps understandable that he would feel that Christmas is a sham. To the modern ear, “humbug” seems to have lost its original meaning entirely; it is now forever known as Scrooge’s catchphrase and carries a connotation of grumpiness.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  What right [or]… reason have you to be merry? You’re poor enough.
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Scrooge equates wealth with happiness, and therefore finds no reason why Fred should be happy because he is not wealthy. Fred immediately points out that Scrooge is wealthy yet not happy. Clearly this inconsistency had not occurred to Scrooge, as he is unable to rebut his nephew’s argument.

</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Historically, murderers or suicides were deemed unworthy of a regular Christian burial. Instead, they were buried at a crossroads with no religious ceremony and with a stake through the heart to prevent their tortured souls from troubling the living. In the ancient Celtic religion from which many Christmas traditions sprang, holly offered protection from evil spirits. Ironically in this case, it was also a symbol of eternal life and fertility.
  </p>

  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give it as a reason for not coming now?
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    When Scrooge’s nephew asks him why he won’t come to dinner, Scrooge responds that it is because he got married. Fred points out that he never came even before he was married, so there must be some other reason. Scrooge chooses not to respond to this argument. Later, we learn that Fred is a painful reminder to Scrooge of his sister, Fan. He refuses the invitiation because he prefers to leave that memory buried, but he won’t admit this to Fred.

<dt>
  fifteen shillings a-week
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Below is a description of the denominations of money used in <cite>A Christmas Carol</cite>, from smallest to largest:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>4 farthings = 1 penny</li>
    <li>12 pence (pennies) = 1 shilling</li>
    <li>5 shillings = 1 crown</li>
    <li>4 crowns = 1 pound</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Bob Cratchit has come to be representative of the poor and destitute worker abused by a cruel employer. But how accurate is that, really?
  </p>
  <p>
    On the one hand, as an educated, skilled worker, Cratchit was definitely paid better than London’s typical laborers, who would have received around half of what he made. Fifteen shillings per week would easily have been a livable wage for him had he been a bachelor.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, he would certainly find it difficult to provide for a wife and six children, never mind obtain proper care for the seriously ill Tiny Tim. Indeed, the vision of the Ghost of Christmas Present shows us that Martha also works to bring income for the family, and that Peter would shortly begin working, as well. Additionally, Cratchit likely worked ten hours a day, six days a week, and did not recieve benefits, paid sick leave, etc. Dickens makes sure to mention that Cratchit walks to and from work. If we presume that Scrooge’s office was near the Royal Exchange (as he had business there), it was around an hour each way from Camden Town. We know from the last stave that Cratchit was expected to be at work by 9:00 a.m., therefore he had to leave home by 8:00 a.m. and wouldn’t get home before 8:00 p.m.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some have attempted to translate Cratchit’s salary into modern terms, but there are a variety of ways to attempt this that result in wildly different answers. It’s also hard to say just <em>how</em> unfair Cratchit’s salary was, due to the uncertainty about his exact duties as Scrooge’s clerk. Some have pointed out that Cratchit was most likely acting as a mere bookkeeper rather than a full-fledged accountant, since otherwise he would be so underpaid that it would seem unreasonable for him to be grateful to Scrooge, or to not seek another employer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ultimately, it may be best to set aside these questions, as focusing on how unfair Cratchit’s salary might have been or how it might compare to a modern minimum wage is missing the point of the story. Remember that Scrooge was noted for his honesty; while he was not generous, he paid what he committed to pay and did not cheat his employee. But honesty without charity wasn’t enough to spare him from Marley’s fate. Dickens suggests that as his employer, Scrooge bears some responsibility for Cratchit’s family’s welfare. By shutting everyone out of his life, he not only neglects that responsibility, but his own soul as well.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  …and a wife and family,…
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    The clerk’s circumstances reflect Dickens’s own at the time this was written. As previously mentioned, Dickens was in the midst of a personal financial downturn, and his wife was pregnant with their fifth child.

  <p>
    Bethlem Royal Hospital, colloquially called Bedlam, was a lunatic asylum in London. Scrooge is saying that he feels that he is surrounded by crazy people. This reference is why Dickens refers to Cratchit as a lunatic in the next sentence. The term “bedlam” has come to mean “chaotic uproar.” Today Bethlem Royal Hospital is a modern psychiatric facility.

  Are there no prisons?
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Scrooge’s response to the gentleman is a reflection of a sarcastic question posed by Scottish philosopher Thomas Carlyle in his pamphlet <cite>Chartism</cite>: “Are there not treadmills, gibbets; even hospitals, poor-rates, New Poor-Law?” The Ghost of Christmas Present later reminds Scrooge of these words when he is confronted with the embodiments of Ignorance and Want.

  </figure>
  <p>
    Union workhouses were places where those who were in debt or convicted of minor offenses were sent, where they would engage in hard menial labor for their room and board. Being sent there was pretty much the lowest you could go in the societal ladder outside of prison, and the living conditions were abysmal.

  the Treadmill
</dt>
<dd>
  <figure>
    <img src="treadmill.jpg" alt="people working on a treadmill" />
  </figure>
  <p>
    The treadmill was invented for the purpose of harnessing human walking power to perform useful work. (Thus the name: “tread” meaning “to step” and “mill” meaning “to grind grain into flour.”) English civil engineer Sir William Cubitt had treadmills installed in prisons to extract labor from prisoners. The prisoners would climb steps mounted on a large wheel while holding a handrail for stability. The long, eight-hour shifts on the treadmill also kept them occupied and tired, and thus less likely to cause trouble. As you can see from the illustration, catastrophe awaited the unfortunate soul who was unable to keep up.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  the Poor Law
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    The Poor Law was the government framework obstensibly for helping the poor and needy, though in practice, it tended to keep them poor instead. In that respect, it was not unlike modern government welfare. <cite>A Christmas Carol</cite> and <cite>Oliver Twist</cite> both portray the Poor Law negatively, and both were a source of embarassment to those in government responsible for it.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  If they would rather die,… they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Scrooge’s views here may have been influenced by English economist Thomas Malthus, who held that population growth was the cause of a variety of social ills. Interestingly, both Dickens and Malthus were opposed to the Poor Law, though the latter’s opposition was due to its effect on inflation rather than on people.
  </p>
  <p>
    During Scrooge’s encounter with the Ghost of Christmas Present, as he is confronted with the future death of Tiny Tim, the spirit reminds him of these words.

    Holly was part of Celtic tradition before Christianity; the druids wore holly in their hair, believing that holly leaves protected against evil spirits, and were a symbol of eternal life and fertility. Holly was used in European heraldry as a symbol of truth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Holly became part of Christian tradition in part due to its symbolism: The leaves come to sharp points, reminding one of the crown of thorns worn by Christ during his crucifixion. The red berries were symbolic of drops of Christ’s blood. The bark of the holly plant is bitter, like the gall offered to Christ on the cross. The fact that the plant is evergreen is representative of life after death. The lyrics of the Christmas carol “The Holly and the Ivy” discuss the Christian symbolism of the holly, and also mention ivy as being representative of the Virgin Mary.

<dd>
  <p>
    A crown was equal to five shillings. As Cratchit was paid 15 shillings (or three crowns) a week and worked six days a week, half a crown (or two shillings and sixpence) would constitute one day’s pay. Withholding that half-crown, then, would be to refuse to pay Cratchit for that day in which he did not work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that Cratchit having Sundays off was a practical consideration for Scrooge: other businesses would be closed, and it would be unprofitable for Scrooge to keep his open when no business could be conducted.

The Court of Aldermen is an elected body within that corporation with certain administrative responsibilities. The livery companies are trade associations and guilds, which heavily influence the government of the City of London. They evolved from medieval guilds and were made corporations under royal charter. In describing Scrooge’s lack of fancy, Dickens is also taking a jab at the dull and unimaginitive politicians of his day.

    In larger Victorian homes, in order to call someone from another part of the house, a room would be fitted with a bell pull that connected to a bell located elsewhere. Usually, multiple rooms in a house would have bell pulls which connected to bells mounted on a board in the servant wing, so that the residents of the home could easily summon a servant to wherever they happened to be in the house. However, this bell is located in Scrooge’s room. It’s possible that it used to be a servant’s room, as much of the house is used as offices.

<dt>
  chained ghosts
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Ghosts were thought to be clothed in whatever they were wearing when they died. Therefore, it stood to reason that the spirit of someone who died in prison would wear the chains they were shackled with in life, and thus continue their penance in the afterlife. We soon learn that Marley’s chains come not from what he was physically wearing at his death, but from the desires of his heart in life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pliny the Younger relates a ghost story in one of his letters. In the story, Athenodorus the philosopher stays in a home said to be haunted, and is visited by a ghost. It leads him to a spot where its corpse is found, still wearing its chains. The bones were collected and given a proper burial, and the haunting of the house ceased. In the story, the ghost’s chains are mentioned casually, as if it was not a novel idea even then. Thus, in chaining Marley, Dickens is relying on an old trope that was as well-known to his audience then as it is to us today.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  Marley’s chains
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    In March 1842, Dickens visited the Western Penitentiary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Seeing chained prisoners there affected him deeply, and this experience may have influenced Marley’s appearance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The chains with which Marley is weighed down reflect the desires of his heart in life, and that our actions (or inactions) have consequences. Marley’s entire life was focused on the goal of profit, and now in the afterlife he is cumbered with the chain he himself created.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Dante’s <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>, the fourth circle of Hell is populated by those who committed the sin of Greed. Those who inhabit this circle are compelled to push great weights. Marley takes the role of Virgil to Scrooge’s Dante, but his chains indicate that he is also condemned for his greed. There are multiple parallels between <cite>A Christmas Carol</cite> and the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>, but this is one of the clearest.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  …Marley had no bowels…
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    This is a reference to 1 John 3:17: “But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?” At the time, the bowels, like the heart, were considered a source of human emotion. Marley having no bowels indicates that he had no compassion for his fellow man in need during his life. However, Dickens’s love of puns compels him to point out that Marley’s transparency allows one to verify that he literally has no intestines.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  …folded kerchief bound about its head and chin…
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    The cloth was tied around the head of the deceased to keep the mouth from gaping. Marley later removes it to allow his jaw to drop, possibly to terrify Scrooge into submission.
  </p>

<dt>
  “You’re particular—for a shade.” He was going to say “<em>to</em> a shade,” but substituted this, as more appropriate.
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    “To a shade” means “somewhat,” but “shade” can also mean “ghost.” Dickens explains later that Scrooge is trying to be clever to distract himself from the terror of his current situation.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  There’s more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!
</dt>
<dd>

    Scrooge continues to attempt to distract himself with smart remarks. He retorts with this play on words that Marley’s appearance is the result of indigestion (“gravy”) rather than the supernatural (“grave”).

  <p>
    Scrooge still does not wish to face the reality of Marley’s visit, so he instead tries to find reasons to reject it by looking for inconsistencies in his story. Marley, who suffers greatly and has gone through some effort to spare Scrooge from his own fate, understandably does not respond well to this.

<dt>
  That blessed Star
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Marley references the story of the Nativity, in which a star appeared which guided the Wise Men to the Christ child. Had they not seen the star, they would never have been able to visit the child Jesus. Similarly, Marley’s self-absorbtion prevented him from receiving the blessings of service to others.
  </p>

<dt>
  You will be haunted… by Three Spirits.
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
   Dickens’s first novel, <cite>The Pickwick Papers</cite>, featured a story called “The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton,” in which a character much like Scrooge has a change of heart about Christmas after being shown the past and future by visiting goblins. This was undoubtedly a precursor to <cite>A Christmas Carol</cite>.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  Scrooge’s countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost’s had done.

</dd>

<dt>
  “Couldn’t I take ’em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?” hinted Scrooge.
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Scrooge has not yet understood the importance of the Spirits’ visits, only seeing them as an inconvenience and an interruption to his sleep, so he attempts to negociate with Marley to combine them into one visit.

    At the time <cite>A Christmas Carol</cite> was published, the United States was in the midst of a severe economic downturn, and its securities were not particularly good investments. Dickens says here that if time stopped moving forward, debts owed to him would be worth as much as a US security: little or nothing.

</dd>

<dt>
  holly and summer flowers
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Holly grows in winter, while most flowers grow during the warm months of the year. This is an emblem of the incongruity that is characteristic of this ghost, and is possibly symbolic of contradictory human nature. People are not consistent, and the person someone was in the past may be very different than who they are today. We soon see that this is true of Scrooge as well: he enjoyed companionship and love in the past, but Belle soon notes a “changed nature” into what eventually became the present-day Scrooge, one very unlike his past self.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  …from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible…
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    The light that emanates from the ghost’s head symbolizes memories from the past which can illuminate the present.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ghost’s appearance is suggestive of a candle. Pagans used candles during the winter solstice as a reminder of the coming spring. Among Christians, the candle references John 8:12, in which Jesus states, “I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” Lutheran priest Johann Hinrich Wichern is credited with developing the Advent wreath in the 16th century, with four candles arranged on a wreath, with one candle being lit each Sunday of Advent. The candles individually represent hope, peace, joy, and love. Sometimes, a fifth candle was lit in the center on Christmas Day, representing the Star of Bethlehem, and by extension, Christ.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  extinguisher
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    A candle was sometimes put out by placing a conical device called an extinguisher over it. The ghost’s extinguisher represents the desire to ignore the past, and forfeit the wisdom its light can bring.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  the ghost’s shifting appearance
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    The ghost’s alternating between a distinct and indistict appearance may be symbolic of the nature of human memory. While you may have a foggy recollection of many events in your past, others will be as clear and distinct as if they happened today. Some have conjectured that the shifts in the ghost’s appearance may also represent the various people who were part of Scrooge’s past.

  <p>
    Scrooge’s father sent him to a boarding school. Unlike the other children, he was not brought home for Christmas.
  </p>
  <p>
    The strained relationship between Scrooge and his father may have been influenced by Dickens’s own father. When Dickens was only 12 years old, his father was sent to the Marshalsea (a debtor’s prison in Southwark) as a result of his careless spending. To survive, Dickens had to quit school and work in a shoe polish factory. This experience had a profound influence on Dickens which is apparent throughout <cite>A Christmas Carol</cite>.

    A Welsh (or Welch) wig is a type of woolen cap which had a long back to keep the neck warm, which was quite common among men at the time. Fezziwig may have been bald, and wore the cap to keep his head warm. It is so named because it somewhat resembles a wig, especially since the back often was made to look like curly hair; and because the wool often originated from Wales. Many illustrations and adaptions inaccurately show Fezziwig wearing an actual wig, but they had gone out of fashion by this time.

Indeed, mince-pies served during the Christmas season were often designed to look like the baby Jesus in a manger. Originally, mince-pies also contained minced meat (frequently mutton), but this had been largely dropped from the recipe by the Victorian era. Mince pies were a traditional food left out for Father Christmas by British children on Christmas Eve.

<dd>
  <p>
    The practice of decorating one’s home with boughs of green plants (particularly of evergreen trees, holly, mistletoe, and ivy) was well established at this time, but the Christmas tree itself was relatively new. The tradition was imported from Germany by Queen Charlotte, but the practice did not spread much beyond the royal family for quite some time. It was only around the time of the publication of <cite>A Christmas Carol</cite> did it start to catch on, and even then, it was more common among the wealthier families which were following the royal trend. Thus, it is probable that the “living green” mentioned here does not refer to Christmas trees. (Note the mention of berries.)

    Wreaths were most anciently worn as crowns by the Etruscans, Greeks, and Romans. In particular, the Greeks and Romans wore laurel wreaths to symbolize victory and achievement, and were received anciently by the winners in the Olympic Games. The wreath was later used by Christians as an Advent decoration, topped with candles.
  </p>
  <p>
    The wreath worn by the spirit is made with holly, which as was previously noted, carries meaningful symbolism in both Christian and pagan tradition. Notably, like the ghost, druids wore it in their hair as protection from evil.

  the Spirit’s appearance
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    The description of the Ghost of Christmas Present is intended to resemble the appearance of Father Christmas from English folklore. The first edition drawings by John Leech also resemble him. It should be noted that the American version known as Santa Claus today was not particularly well known in England at this time, despite his introduction in Clement Clark Moore’s <cite>A Visit from St. Nicholas</cite> 21 years earlier.

  <p>
    Each of the Spirit’s brothers represents one year’s Christmas season, and each lives only during the Twelve Days of Christmas. The first day of Christmas is Christmas itself, so the Ghost is indeed very young (less than two hours old, in fact).
  </p>
  <p>
    The original manuscript had the ghost refer to his “oldest brother” (i.e. Jesus Christ), but Dickens removed this, feeling it too irreverent.

  …and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe.
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Kissing under the mistletoe had its origins in Norse mythology. Baldr and his mother Frigg dreamed that Baldr was to die. Frigg extracted promises from all living things not to harm Baldr, except the mistletoe, which was apparently too non-threatening to bother. Loki used mistletoe to fashion a spear or arrow, which was used to kill Baldr.
  </p>
  <p>
    Frigg declared that from that day forward mistletoe would never again be used as a weapon, but would be a symbol of peace and love, vowing to give a kiss to anyone who walked underneath one. It was even held that mistletoe berries were Frigg’s tears. If enemies met in the wood under a mistletoe, tradition required that they must lay aside their weapons and depart in peace. Likewise, people would meet under the mistletoe in order to show a willingness to reconcile.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s possible that this tradition became associated with Christmas tangentially from the hanging of the mistletoe to keep away the evil spirits. One of the earliest mentions of kissing under the mistletoe came, in fact, from Dickens’s first novel, <cite>The Pickwick Papers</cite>. Traditionally, a young lady caught under the mistletoe must grant a requested kiss or she would not be married the following year.

  …close these places on the Seventh Day?
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    There was a movement around this time to legally require all people to observe the Sabbath Day. Dickens was opposed to this movement, and even wrote a work critical of an act of Parliament spearheaded by Andrew Agnew (one of four attempts) designed to enforce Sabbath observance. He observed that the closure of bakeries on Sundays would disproportionately affect the poor, as the wealthy had the means for their dinners to be cooked within their homes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Scrooge’s statement that these acts were done in the name of the spirit’s family indicates that his work is not to be taken soley as a holiday story or a social commentary, but as a Christian allegory. The conflict with Sabbatarians can be compared to the criticism received by Jesus’s disciples in the Gospel of Mark when they ate grain as they walked by fields on the Sabbath. Here the ghost’s reply to Scrooge may be likened to Jesus’s to the Jews that “the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.” Dickens chastises those who would put greater importance on religious rules than people, and particularly those whose enforcement of such rules would have little to no impact on themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Ghost of Christmas Present is the most outspoken of the spirits, and largely serves as Dickens’s mouthpiece for his views.

  <p>
    The Ghost of Christmas Present can change size easily, in particular noted to shrink to stand inside the humblest of homes.

  Bob Cratchit
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    A “bob,” as noted later in the paragraph, is slang for a shilling. The word “cratchit” has multiple meanings; the one most relevant is probably “stomach,” as despite his small income, his family manages to make the most of it to provide an enjoyable Christmas dinner, as we will see.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  …in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence…
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    At this time, everything people owned was made by hand. Weaving cloth and constructing clothing was a manual, labor-intensive task. Therefore, cloth and clothing were much more expensive than they are today. When an article of clothing began looking shabby, instead of throwing it out, the poorer folk would “turn” it by carefully taking it apart, cleaning it, then sewing it back together inside-out. Mrs. Cratchit, in her frugality, rather than incur the expense to purchase or create a new gown, has opted to turn her already-turned dress again. In order to attempt to hide the shabbiness of her clothing, she has decorated it with ribbons, which were inexpensive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sixpence (six pennies) is equivalent to half a shilling, or one-fifth of Bob Cratchit’s daily wage.

  goose
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Before the Spanish brought turkeys to Europe in the 16th century, goose or chicken was commonly had for Christmas dinner. The wealthy sometimes had swan or peafowl.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pubs often ran “goose clubs” where members would pay a small weekly amount toward a goose. When Christmastime came, the pub owner would buy the geese in bulk and assign them out to the paid members via random drawing. This arrangement was beneficial for the club members because they didn’t have to pay for a goose all at once, and the pub owner benefited because the club members stopping in to make their weekly payment would often buy a pint. This arrangement is probably how the Cratchits bought their goose.
  </p>
  <p>
    A goose from a goose club kicks off another well-known Victorian era Christmas story, “The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle” from <cite>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</cite>.

  </p>
  <p>
    Tiny Tim being borne on his father’s shoulder is symbolic of the financial burden his illness places on the family. Dickens is not specific about what ails the child, but it has been suggested that he might suffer from renal tubular acidosis, tuberculosis, or rickets.

  <p>
    Christmas pudding is a boiled dessert consisting of dried fruits, egg, suet, treacle or molasses, and spices. In America it would be called a fruitcake. It was wrapped in a cloth and then steamed in a “copper,” or metal boiler, so named because historically they were made of that metal, although by this time it was more likely iron. The escaping steam would cause a whistle, which is the “singing” spoken of. After steaming for a long time, it was “turned out” of the copper, unwrapped from the cloth, set on a plate, doused in brandy, and set alight.

Bob, however, is thankful to Scrooge, as without him, he would be unable to provide for his family, much less enjoy their Christmas meal. This scene between him and his wife is here to highlight his gratitude and positivity, which is revisited in Scrooge’s vision of their future.

    Child labor was common in those days, particularly among the poorer classes, as many families would find it very difficult survive unless the children also brought income. Some worked as much as 16 hours a day. Dickens himself had worked in a factory at the age of 12, with his father shut up in a debtor’s prison. A series of parliamentary acts called the Factory Acts gradually improved conditions for children, culminating in the Factory and Workshop Act of 1878, which banned employment for children under 10, mandated education for all children 10 and under, and prohibited 10-14 year olds from working more than half days.

  <blockquote>
    There is heard a hymn when the panes are dim,<br />
    And never before or again,<br />
    When the nights are strong with a darkness long,<br />
    And the dark is alive with rain.<br />
    <br />
    Never we know but in sleet and in snow,<br />
    The place where the great fires are,<br />
    That the midst of the earth is a raging mirth<br />
    And the heart of the earth a star.<br />
    <br />
    And at night we win to the ancient inn<br />
    Where the child in the frost is furled,<br />
    We follow the feet where all souls meet<br />
    At the inn at the end of the world.<br />
    <br />

    For the flame of the sun is flown,<br />
    The gods lie cold where the leaves lie gold,<br />
    And a Child comes forth alone.

With this reference, Dickens compares Angelo to those who shut out the influence of Ghost of Christmas Present. They may be able to forbid entrance to the Spirit, but their authority is indeed brief. When men die, their earthly authority dies with them, but the Spirit of Christmas is everlasting.

  Ignorance and Want
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    The two children the Ghost of Christmas Present shows to Scrooge are called Ignorance and Want. The former represents society’s abandonment of the poor, while the latter represents the resulting consequences. Children are guiltless of the evils which bring about Ignorance and Want and yet are the ones that suffer most from it; thus Dickens represents them with a little boy and girl.
  </p>
  <p>
    Scrooge’s visions of the Cratchit home show his personal involvement with them: his choice to remain ignorant of the family’s plight will result in Tiny Tim’s death from want of nourishment. The Ghost indicates that Ignorance is the greater danger, as without it Want can be overcome. As he states, the doom written on his forehead may be erased.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is the Ghost of Christmas Present who displays the children to Scrooge rather than the other spirits because it is only in the present that anything can be done. Simply thinking about what has happened in the past or contemplating what you may do about it in the future results in no change; it is present day action that is required.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ignorance and Want being personified as destitute children was inspired by a visit Dickens made to a school for poor children in London’s East End.

    There is no indication whether Scrooge recognized the charwoman or the laundress. Perhaps he did and it just wasn’t mentioned.

    Echoing his previous display of gratitude during Scrooge’s visit with the Ghost of Christmas Present, Bob Cratchet looks for the positive in the wake of Tiny Tim’s death. It has brought about his encounter with Fred, who offers to help his family, and possibly provide better employment for Peter. Although Bob doesn’t say as much, Tim’s death removes from the family the burden of treating his illness. Overall, it seems their financial prospects will improve. But Bob is especially pleased that the family’s mourning has brought them closer together.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most people, when comparing Scrooge and Bob, focus on their financial circumstances: Scrooge is rich and Bob is poor. But this is the real difference between them: Scrooge is unhappy in spite of his prosperity, while Bob is happy even though he has every reason to be miserable. Happiness comes as a result of our choices, not our circumstances.

    In Quintus Smyrnaeus’s <cite>Posthomerica</cite>, Laocoön warned the Trojans to burn the wooden horse left by the Greeks instead of taking it into the city. This angered the goddess Athena, and as part of his punishment, she sent two giant sea serpents to strangle him and his two sons. This event is depicted in an ancient statue, <cite>Laocoön and His Sons</cite>, excavated in Rome in 1506, which is to this day on public display in the Vatican. The statue portrays the three humans entangled with the sea serpents, and this passage is in reference to the statue: Scrooge is similarly entangled by his stockings.

  <p>
    Turkeys were imported from Mexico by the Spanish in the 16th century, and a turkey industry was soon established in Europe and Middle East. Londoners often bought their turkeys from Middle Eastern sellers, who they referred to as Turkey (Turkish) merchants. This is why the animal is called a turkey in English, despite originating from the Americas.
  </p>
  <p>
      Until the Victorian era, the goose and chicken were still more common than turkey on the Christmas dinner table, especially among the poor since turkeys were more expensive. The Cratchits would consider any turkey to be a rare feast indeed, much more so one so large as the turkey bought by Scrooge. <cite>A Christmas Carol</cite> contributed significantly to the establishment of the turkey as the traditional Christmas dinner in England.
  </p>
  <p>
    Turkeys were principally raised in Norfolk and Suffolk, both approximately a hundred miles from London. In late summer and early fall, farmers walked large flocks of turkeys to London in what were called “turkey drives.” They would travel slowly and allow frequent grazing to avoid too much weight loss, then fatten them up again in London before they were sold.

    Scrooge is offering to multiply the payment by 2½ times if the boy is quick. As established in Stave One, half a crown is equivalent to Bob Cratchit’s (soon to be increased) daily wage.

    Joseph Miller (1684-1738) was an English actor. The book <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40127/40127-h/40127-h.htm" target="_blank"><cite>Joe Miller’s Jests, or the Wit’s Vade-Mecum</cite></a>, published posthumously, was the first of a series of joke books distributed under his name. Many of the jokes therein were considered time-worn and not particularly funny, such that an old, unfunny joke came to be called a “Joe Miller.” Here is joke 55 from the aforementioned book:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    Several Years ago when Mrs. Rogers the Player, was young and handsome, Lord North, and Grey, remarkable for his homely Face, accosting her one Night behind the Scenes, ask’d her with a Sigh, what was a Cure for Love? Your Lordship, said she, the best I know in the World.

  <p>
    “Cab” refers to a hansom cab. The word “cab” itself is short for “cabriolet,” a light, two-wheeled carriage drawn by a single horse. The hansom cab was designed and patented by Joseph Hansom, whose name became part of the name of the vehicle. It was quite popular for hired transportation, due to their speed and ability to steer around traffic jams.

  <p>
    A mulled wine or wassail, made with port, red wine, citrus fruit, sugar, and spices. The “smoking” part of the name comes from the fact that it is served steaming warm. The “bishop” part is less certain: it may be from its deep red color, like a bishop’s robe. Another theory is that the traditional bowl from which it was served was shaped like a bishop’s mitre.

<dd>
  <p>
    “Intercourse” here means “interaction.” The Total Abstinence Principle was a pledge to completely abstain from alcoholic beverages. Dickens graces us with one more pun at the end of the book: Scrooge has no more interaction with spirits (which can mean both “ghosts” and “alcohol”).
